The project aims to create an application dedicated to efficiently managing the civil status records of citizens within a specific province. Civil status records encompass vital information such as births, marriages, and divorces, and it's crucial for government and administrative purposes. The project has undergone a rigorous analysis and design phase, which has culminated in the development of a comprehensive class diagram.

The class diagram serves as a blueprint for the application's structure, depicting the various classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It outlines how the different components of the application, like citizens, events, and administrative functions, are interconnected.
